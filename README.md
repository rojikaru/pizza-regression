# 🍕 Pizza Price Prediction - Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores a regression model applied to predict pizza prices based on various features. The notebook is part of a machine learning coursework project.

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and apply regression techniques to predict pizza prices using given features. The notebook walks through:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

### Key Objectives

- Load and explore the pizza dataset
- Handle missing values, encoding, and scaling
